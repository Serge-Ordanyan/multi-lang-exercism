# difference of squares

welcome to difference of squares on exercism's rust track.
if you need help running the tests or submitting your code, check out `help.md`.

## instructions
find the difference between the square of the sum and the sum of the squares of the first n natural numbers.

the square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is
(1 + 2 + ... + 10)² = 55² = 3025.

the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is
1² + 2² + ... + 10² = 385.

hence the difference between the square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers and the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

you are not expected to discover an efficient solution to this yourself from first principles; research is allowed, indeed, encouraged.
finding the best algorithm for the problem is a key skill in software engineering.
